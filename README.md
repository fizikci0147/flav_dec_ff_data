This repository includes F1u and F1d data extracted from both proton and neutron form factors for the "Charge radii of the nucleon from its flavor dependent Dirac form factors" paper. F1u and F1d data that was extracted from proton and neutron can be found in F1u_F1d_proton.txt and  F1u_F1d_neutron.txt files respectively. Lattice QCD data that was extracted in the paper by M.Constantinou can be found in the F1u_F1d_lattice.txt file. File formats are:

Q2(GeV/c)^2   F1u    dF1u    F1d     dF1d
